# bike-crash-detection-system
This project was made in accordance with the theme of NC RISE competition that took place in 2019 at UPES Dehradun.  In this project IMU 6050 was used to detect the crash of the bike. The speed and the roll angle of the bike was used to detect the crash of the bike and separate it from fall in stand still or low speed fall.  A GPS  was used to find the location of the crash. An esp32 was used in the project. The connection to the internet could be  established using two ways. The first was through local public wi-fi  whose detail were already stored in the script. The second was through the hotspot of the users mobile. To get the detail for this connection a Bluetooth module Was also connected to the system. To allow the user to pass this info an app was created which connected to the system through Bluetooth and allowed user to pass the info regarding the network . The app also collected personal information of the driver.  After collecting all the information the ESP made a judgement to choose among all the network available  according to their strength and started operating on the data from the IMU and the GPS. In case of a detection the ESP would send the data to a remote system to whom many such systems were connected.  The system was a google spread sheet on which the details regarding the person and the  GPS coordinate of the crash  were  collected. These GPS coordinates were also plotted on google earth.
